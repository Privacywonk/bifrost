#Definitions
# Originating Side = the host that runs this script that connects to a remote side and creates a tunnel back to itself
# remote side - the tunnel host.

keyFilePath="" #path to private key identity file
SSHremotePort="22" #remote side SSH service port. Normally 22, change if different
SSHTunnelPort="2222" #remote side port that the tunnel will be bound to (think high port numbers, e.g. 2222, 5555, etc.) 
SSHlocalPort="22" #port where SSH runs on the originating side (normally 22, change if different)
identity="username@host" #username and IP/host of remote side 

 # This command will create a tunnel on the remote side, bound to the remote side *localhost only* to the SSHTunnelPort.  
 # on the remote side it can be accessed by: /usr/bin/ssh -l username -p 2222 localhost (where username is a user on the originating system)
 # this will connect back to the originating side SSH service and present you with a login prompt or accept your key and log you in.
